## A Brief Autobiography

Yan-Tong Lin is currently a junior in NCTU majoring in Computer Science.

He had developed a strong interest in science since the age of 9 and read a lot of books, including ones about mathematics and C++ programming. And he self-learned several topics in high school mathematics, including calculus, during his free time in junior high.  

He passed the admission exam of the 4th CKHS Science Class and entered the NTHU high school student program of Chemistry in the same year.
In the third year of senior high school, he got his first exposure to algorithm design, competitive programming, and artificial intelligence during an activity held by Taiwan Coder League and was highly inspired.  

He entered NTU CSIE in 2015.  
Unfortunately, due to some relationship issues, he was unable to finish his studies at NTU for depression.  
Afterward, he entered NCTU Department of Applied Mathematics with the highest admission score of College Entrance Examination in Specified Subjects.  

He studied in both mathematics and computer science during the past two years (majors in applied mathematics in 2018-2019 and computer science in 2020).  
In the 2019 fall semester, he joined NCTU PCCA(Programming Challenging Contest Association) and started to strike success in plenty of individual contests, including taking 541st place in Round 3 of Google Code Jam 2020.  

Various studies have been conducted during his college time. For example, construction of an AI program for NoGo using MCTS(Monte Carlo tree search) with RAVE(rapid action value estimation) at CGI lab lead by Dr. I-Chen Wu, finding a solution to k-MaxVD (max vertex domination of k-vertex subset) for trees in time complexity $O(k|V|)$ with Dr. Chiuyuan Chen and Dr. Meng-Tsung Tsai, and building a natural language inference model with a graph neural network variant at NLU lab, Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica lead by Dr. Keh-Yih Su.  

Together with the teammates from NTU ALCom Lab, he won the Best Presentation Award in NTU-IBMQ 2020 QCamp, the first quantum hackathon in Taiwan, by integrating a proposed quantum simulator to the Qiskit package.  

In the current semester, he is taking the following courses: Algebra I, Advanced Linear Algebra, Quantum Computation and Information, Introduction to Computer Graphics, Introduction to Operating System. He is also having weekly meetings with Dr. Ming-Hsuan Kang and attending the seminars of the lab lead by [Dr. Kai-Ming Chung](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~kmchung/).
 
He is now enthusiastic about the field of theoretical computer science, especially in quantum computation and information. With the accumulated knowledge and strong problem-solving technique, he is ready to study and contribute to the field in the short future.  

(News: 2020/12/1) gains admission to Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering (group of DS), National Taiwan University.
